# Ant Runner
A .Net programming exercise game. Create an AI for your cyborg ant to battle up to 8 cyborg ants in a game of capture the flag. Ants are ranomly places on the map knowing only the map size, their starting position, and their own color. They must use echo location to find their way around the map being careful not to run into walls, other ants, or step on bombs. Your ant isn't defense less, it's armed with a high powered laser cannon, a defensive energy shield, and can pick up bombs to deploy traps for other ants.
